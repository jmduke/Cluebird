A crossword helper app for iOS.

This is an actual app on the App Store.  If you're reading this repository, please do me a favor and [download it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cluebird-crossword-helper/id1162829250?ls=1&mt=8)!

Please feel free to use this repository as an example or whatever: it's the entire thing you need to run the app, minus some constants and the database of answers and clues.  (If you're super interested in getting those, feel free to [email me](mailto:me@jmduke.com).)
